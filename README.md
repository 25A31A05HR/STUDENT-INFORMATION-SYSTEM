🎓 Student Management System (C++)
📌 Overview
This project is a menu-driven Student Management System developed in C++ using a singly linked list. It allows users to manage student records dynamically without any fixed size limitation.

🚀 Features
➕ Add Student
🔍 Search Student (by Roll Number)
✏️ Modify Student Details
❌ Delete Student
📋 Display All Students
🔁 Menu-driven interface
🧠 Methodology
The system is implemented using a linked list data structure, where each student record is stored in a node.

Dynamic memory allocation (new, delete) is used
Each node stores student details and a pointer to the next node
Operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal are performed using pointers
A while loop with switch-case controls the menu
⚙️ Technologies Used
Language: C++

Concepts:

Linked List
Pointers
Dynamic Memory Allocation
File Handling (optional enhancement)
📊 Flowchart

🏗️ Data Structure
Each student is stored as a node:

class node {
public:
    int roll_no, phone_no;
    string name, address, mail_id;
    node* link;
};
▶️ How to Run
Compile the code:
g++ student.cpp -o student
Run the program:
./student
